* R Packages
- [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html][CRAN Task View: High-Performance and Parallel Computing with R]] 
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_with_Big_Data_in_R][pbdR]] :: Collection of packages allowing for distributed computing
     with R. 
- [[https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future][future]] :: Lowish-level, can evaluate expressions on clusters
     provided by =parallel=
- [[https://github.com/DavisVaughan/furrr][furrr]] :: attaching the =future= backend to the =purrr= frontend
- [[https://github.com/delta-rho/rhipe][RHIPE]] :: A means of using Hadoop from R, providing an Integrated
     Programming Environment. Function reference:
  - [[http://deltarho.org/docs-RHIPE/functionref.html][RHIPE docs]]
- [[https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/foreach][foreach]] :: A high-level looping construct, with various backends
     (including various clusters as described on it's GitHub page;
     relevant is [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doSNOW/index.html][doSNOW]]). Tutorials:
  - [[https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-wonders-of-foreach/][The Wonders of foreach]]
- [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/snow/index.html][snow]] :: Parallel and distributed computing in R, now mostly subsumed
     into the =parallel= package, in turn part of core R. Tutorials:
  - [[http://www.sfu.ca/~sblay/R/snow.html][snow Simplified]]
  - [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17899756/initializing-mpi-cluster-with-snowfall-r][Info on multiple node setup (using snowfall, a wrapper for snow)]]

  - Vignette - interesting reading:
#+BEGIN_SRC R

#+END_SRC
- [[https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki][RHadoop]] :: A collection of five packages from Revolution Analytics
     to run Hadoop directly from R. Packages include:
  - [[https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/rmr2][rmr2]] :: To run MapReduce jobs directly from R
  - [[https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/rhdfs][rhdfs]] :: To access HDFS from R
- [[https://github.com/vertica/DistributedR][DistributedR]] :: Cluster access for various R data structures.
     Impressively home-made, no Hadoop backend etc. No longer in
     development (last commit 2015 - did a meteorite hit in that
     year??). The creators, Vertica, have moved on to offering an
     enterprise database platform.
- [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpi/index.html][Rmpi]] :: An R interface to MPI
- [[https://www.rforge.net/doc/packages/multicore/multicore.html][multicore]] :: Developed by Simon, enables multicore processing with
               =mclapply=. Merged with =snow= to form =parallel=.
               Doesn't work on Windows, as it makes use of forked
               processes, which is not supported by Windows.
- [[https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html][SparkR]] :: Provides a front-end to Spark from R. Provides the Spark
     DataFrame as primary object of interest. Maintained directly by
     Apache Spark.
- [[https://spark.rstudio.com/][Sparklyr]] :: Connects to spark from R, using [[https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html][dplyr]] as primary tool of
     manipulation. Maintained by RStudio. Can connect to H2O using
     [[https://github.com/h2oai/sparkling-water/tree/master/r][Sparkling Water]], with [[https://github.com/h2oai/rsparkling][rsparkling]] providing conversion. This
     allows access to the distributed ML algorithms provided by H2O.

* Other Software and R-Derivatives
- [[http://deltarho.org][DeltaRho]] :: A simple frontend for and from RHIPE
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapR][MapR]] :: Was initially providing R access to Hadoop (Just HDFS as far
     as I can tell). Bought out by HP in May 2019, only selling an
     enterprise database platform (+ basic analytics services) running
     on Hadoop and other backends.
- [[https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/hdinsight/r-server/#security][R Server for HDInsight]] :: Originally Revolution R, then Microsoft R.
     A distribution of R with special emphasis on parallel
     capabilities. Offers multi-threaded maths libraries out the box.
- [[https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSPT3X_3.0.0/com.ibm.swg.im.infosphere.biginsights.analyze.doc/doc/t_overview_bigr.html][IBM Big R]] :: Introduction of bigr classes replicating base R types.
     Runs on the [[https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSPT3X_3.0.0/com.ibm.swg.im.infosphere.biginsights.welcome.doc/doc/welcome.html][InfoSphere BigInsights]] platform, "powered by Apache
     Hadoop". Automatic MapReduce.
