* R Packages
- [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/HighPerformanceComputing.html][CRAN Task View: High-Performance and Parallel Computing with R]] 
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_with_Big_Data_in_R][pbdR]] :: Collection of packages allowing for distributed computing
     with R. 
- [[https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future][future]] :: Lowish-level, can evaluate expressions on clusters
     provided by =parallel=
- [[https://github.com/DavisVaughan/furrr][furrr]] :: attaching the =future= backend to the =purrr= frontend
- [[https://github.com/delta-rho/rhipe][RHIPE]] :: A means of using Hadoop from R, providing an Integrated
     Programming Environment. Function reference:
  - [[http://deltarho.org/docs-RHIPE/functionref.html][RHIPE docs]]
- [[https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/foreach][foreach]] :: A high-level looping construct, with various backends
     (including various clusters as described on it's GitHub page;
     relevant is [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doSNOW/index.html][doSNOW]]). Tutorials:
  - [[https://www.r-bloggers.com/the-wonders-of-foreach/][The Wonders of foreach]]
- [[https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/doFuture][dofuture]] :: provides an adapter for foreach that works on a
     future-based backend. Note that this does not mean returning
     foreach() calls as futures. Claims to enable parallelism, but
     unclear how this does anything over what the [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doParallel/index.html][doParallel]] package
     provides, as they both use them as backends. --- Because future
     backends can include other clusters, such as those provided by
     batchtools, so the multicore stuff in future is redundant, but
     the other backends are not necessarily.
- [[https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.batchtools][future.batchtools]] :: provides a future API for [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/batchtools/index.html][batchtools]], or
     equivalently, a batchtools backend for future. Allows the use of
     various cluster schedulers such as TORQUE, Slurm, Docker Swarm, or
     custom cluster functions.
- [[https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.apply][future.apply]] :: provides equivalent functions to R's =apply=
     functions, with a future backend enabling parallel, cluster, and
     other functionality as enabled by backends such as batchtools
     through future.batchtools
- [[https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.callr][future.callr]] :: provides a callr backend to future, with all of the
     associated advantages and overhead.
- [[https://davisvaughan.github.io/furrr/][furrr]] :: allows the use of future as a backend to purrr
- [[https://purrr.tidyverse.org/][purrr]] :: A set of functional programming tools for R, including map,
     typed map, reduce, predicates, monads. Much of it is redundant to
     what already exists in R, but it does have the advantage of
     adhering to a consistent standard.
- [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/batchtools/index.html][batchtools]] :: provides a parallel implementation of the Map function
     for HPC systems, with a variety of schedulers including Slurm,
     Docker Swarm, TORQUE, etc.
- [[https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.callr][callr]] :: "call R from R". Provides functions to run expressions in a
           background R process. Begins a new session, with the
           associated overhead. Allows more than 125 connections
           ([[https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/Wishlist-for-R/issues/28][maximum number of open connections]]), due to not making use
           of R-specific connections [fn:1]. Additionally, no ports
           are made use of, unlike SOCKcluster provided by the snow
           component of parallel.
- [[https://github.com/s-u/hmr][hmr]] :: an interface to MapReduce from R. Super fast, with chunked
     data, with automatic R object conversion. Based on [[https://github.com/s-u/iotools][iotools]].
- [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/snow/index.html][snow]] :: Parallel and distributed computing in R, now mostly subsumed
     into the =parallel= package, in turn part of core R. Tutorials:
  - [[http://www.sfu.ca/~sblay/R/snow.html][snow Simplified]]
  - [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17899756/initializing-mpi-cluster-with-snowfall-r][Info on multiple node setup (using snowfall, a wrapper for snow)]]
- [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/partools/index.html][partools]] :: Utilities for parallel computation, without
     Hadoop/Spark. More info:

- [[https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/RHadoop/wiki][RHadoop]] :: A collection of five packages from Revolution Analytics
     to run Hadoop directly from R. Packages include:
  - [[https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/rmr2][rmr2]] :: To run MapReduce jobs directly from R
  - [[https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/rhdfs][rhdfs]] :: To access HDFS from R
- [[https://github.com/vertica/DistributedR][DistributedR]] :: Cluster access for various R data structures.
     Impressively home-made, no Hadoop backend etc. No longer in
     development (last commit 2015 - did a meteorite hit in that
     year??). The creators, Vertica, have moved on to offering an
     enterprise database platform.
- [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rmpi/index.html][Rmpi]] :: An R interface to MPI
- [[https://www.rforge.net/doc/packages/multicore/multicore.html][multicore]] :: Developed by Simon, enables multicore processing with
               =mclapply=. Merged with =snow= to form =parallel=.
               Doesn't work on Windows, as it makes use of forked
               processes, which is not supported by Windows.
- [[https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sparkr.html][SparkR]] :: Provides a front-end to Spark from R. Provides the Spark
     DataFrame as primary object of interest. Maintained directly by
     Apache Spark.
- [[https://spark.rstudio.com/][Sparklyr]] :: Connects to spark from R, using [[https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html][dplyr]] as primary tool of
     manipulation. Maintained by RStudio. Can connect to H2O using
     [[https://github.com/h2oai/sparkling-water/tree/master/r][Sparkling Water]], with [[https://github.com/h2oai/rsparkling][rsparkling]] providing conversion. This
     allows access to the distributed ML algorithms provided by H2O.
