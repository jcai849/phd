* Objectives
** Carried [100%]
** New [33%]
- [X] Create weekly logs
- [X] Rearrange repositories
- [ ] Write in more depth on packages; the *what* is done, now look at *how*:
  - [ ] disk.frame <2020-03-31 Tue>, <2020-04-01 Wed>
  - [ ] foreach <2020-04-02 Thu>
- [ ] Take notes on reweighted least squares as an example iterative algorithm <2020-04-03 Fri>
- [ ] Retry cluster simulation <2020-04-06 Mon>
- [ ] Run more complex statistics on cluster; e.g. biglm <2020-04-06 Mon>--<2020-04-07 Tue>
* Journal
** <2020-03-31 Tue>
   - Created [[file:][logs]]
   - Rearranged repositories; moved the contents of [[https://github.com/jcai849/phd-src][phd-src]] to just be
     a subdirectory of [[https://github.com/jcai849/phd][phd]] named "[[../R/][R]]", with no git weirdness like
     submodules, etc. keeping it simple. moved all documents to "[[../doc/][doc]]"
   - Remade makefile to accomodate movement
   - Began reading disk.frame vignettes and source in detail
* Discuss [0/3] 
  - [ ] /Is Hadoop dead? Too many people with opinions online/
  - [ ] /How relevant are applications such as xgboost and redis?/
  - [ ] /Is [[https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5827][software alchemy]] a failed meme?/
