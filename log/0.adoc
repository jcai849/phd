Establishing, Spark, and Features
=================================

== Objectives ==

.Carried
* [ ] Setup Spark on the minicluster
** [ ] Run some tests involving mutate and spark_apply
** [ ] Implement Reweighted Least Squares with sparklyr
** [ ] Compare self-made glm with MLLib glm
** [ ] Reference this within the RWLS document
** [ ] Write on potential and limitations of mutate (with references)
** [ ] Look in detail at how sparklyr performs mutate functions
* [ ] Justify desired features
* [ ] Record the backends commonly supported by backend-powered packages
* [ ] Write on LASSO with reference to the bigmemory implementation
* [ ] Write on other algorithms: ADMM, Random Forest
* [ ] Research possible graph-based algorithms to require node communication

.New
* [ ] More on RWLS document
** [ ] Reference the GLM implementations in sparklyr and pbdR
* [ ] Especial note on debugging ease through interactivity in the features
