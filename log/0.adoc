Establishing, Spark, and Features
=================================

== Objectives ==

.Carried
* [ ] sparklyr testing
** [*] Setup Spark on the minicluster
** [ ] Run some tests involving mutate and spark_apply
** [ ] Implement Reweighted Least Squares with sparklyr
** [ ] Compare self-made glm with MLLib glm
** [ ] Reference this within the RWLS document
** [ ] Write on potential and limitations of mutate (with references)
** [ ] Look in detail at how sparklyr performs mutate functions
* [ ] Justify desired features
** [*] Attain backing literature
** [ ] Read and take further notes on backing literature
** [ ] Compose argument
** [ ] Especial note on ease of debugging when REPL available
* [ ] Record the backends commonly supported by backend-powered packages
	(include these in the survey-large-scale-platforms document, including
	revis and other distributed databases)
* [ ] Write on LASSO with reference to the bigmemory implementation
* [ ] Write on other algorithms: ADMM, Random Forest
* [ ] Research possible graph-based algorithms to require node communication

.New
* [ ] More on RWLS document
** [ ] Reference the GLM implementations in sparklyr and pbdR

*Thursday*::
	- Get VPN working
	- Finalise install of Spark (include details in script)
	- Setup directory profile
	- Download more papers on platform features

== Discuss ==
* Spark not connecting to yarn-client; is yarn set up on cluster?
* Uni offers an svn server (lol)
* VPN painless when using https://uoaprod.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article&sys_id=29e0cb28db3b0050d096cd0514961964[openfortivpn without gui]
