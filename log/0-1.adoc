(Preparing for) Getting My Hands Dirty
======================================

== Objectives ==

.Carried
* [-] Learn more on reweighted least squares as an example iterative
algorithm
** [X] Read on reweighted least squares
** [ ] Take notes
* [ ] Determine if sparklyr mutate occurs locally
* [ ] Retry cluster simulation
* [ ] Run more complex statistics on cluster; e.g. biglm

.New
* [ ] Determine means of foreach global variable detection
* [X] Determine if futures can be persisted
* [ ] Consider attributes important to large-scale R platforms, e.g. API or
	generic classes; Arbitrary code evaluation; persistence of objects;
	communication between nodes
	** [ ] Make a comparison table
* [ ] More on pbdR, with examples:
	** [ ] Do they offer a specialised API, or generics
	** [ ] What does it take to set up?
	** [ ] Do objects persist at nodes?
	** [ ] Implement reweighted least squares
* [ ] Write on LASSO with reference to the bigmemory implementation
* [ ] Write on other algorithms: ADMM, Random Forest
* [ ] Research possible graph-based algorithms to require node communication

[horizontal]
*Tuesday*::
	- Learned vim
	- Learned asciidoc
	- Learned tmux
	- Fixed makefile
*Wednesday*::
	- Finished reading 4.2 ESL
	- Completed log fixing
*Thursday*::
	- learned vimscript, started work on
	  https://github.com/jcai849/send-to-pane[plugin] to send text from vim
	  to R 
*Friday - Monday*::
	- Long Weekend 
*Tuesday*::
	- Meeting postponed for more work to be completed
	- Reading on sparklyr, future, foreach 
*Wednesday*::
	- Crawling through source code of future
	- Writing more detail on sparklyr, file:../doc/detail-future.tex[future], foreach
	- Writing on attributes important to large-scale R platforms

== Discuss ==

* The mechanism of future is very difficult to understand - no documentation
* Would the promises package be useful to look into?
	and the code is quite unclear
