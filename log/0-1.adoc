(Preparing for) Getting My Hands Dirty
======================================

== Objectives ==

.Carried
* [-] Learn more on reweighted least squares as an example iterative
algorithm
** [X] Read on reweighted least squares
** [ ] Take notes
* [ ] Determine if sparklyr mutate occurs locally
* [ ] Retry cluster simulation
* [ ] Run more complex statistics on cluster; e.g. biglm

.New
* [ ] Determine means of foreach global variable detection
* [ ] Determine if futures can be persisted
* [ ] Consider attributes important to large-scale R platforms, e.g. API or
	generic classes; Arbitrary code evaluation; persistence of objects;
	communication between nodes
	** [ ] Make a comparison table
* [ ] More on pbdR, with examples:
	** [ ] Do they offer a specialised API, or generics
	** [ ] What does it take to set up?
	** [ ] Do objects persist at nodes?
	** [ ] Implement reweighted least squares
* [ ] Write on LASSO with reference to the bigmemory implementation
* [ ] Write on other algorithms: ADMM, Random Forest
* [ ] Research possible graph-based algorithms to require node communication
