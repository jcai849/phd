pbdR, Spark, and Enrolment
==========================

== Objectives ==

.Carried
* [*] Implement Reweighted Least Squares with pbdR
* [ ] Write on LASSO with reference to the bigmemory implementation
* [ ] Write on other algorithms: ADMM, Random Forest
* [ ] Research possible graph-based algorithms to require node communication

.New
* [ ] Setup Spark on the minicluster
** [ ] Run some tests involving mutate and spark_apply
** [ ] Implement Reweighted Least Squares with sparklyr
** [ ] Reference this within the RWLS document
** [ ] Write on potential and limitations of mutate (with references)
* [ ] Justify desired features
* [ ] Record the backends commonly supported by backend-powered packages
* [ ] Look in detail at how sparklyr performs mutate functions

== Journal ==

[horizontal]
*Wednesday*::
	- Continue RWLS with pbdR; created test programs in learn-pbdr
	  directory
	- Fix up bibliography, add sources in preparation for more scholaraly
	  justification
*Thursday*::
	- Finish bibliography fixes
	- Paperwork for and acceptance
	- Write on issues with pbdR RWLS
*Friday*::
	- University enrolment
	- Install spark
	- Needing su access to install the myriad dependencies for sparklyr

== Discuss ==
* Should I go into detail on sparkr as well?
* Requiring sudo for sparklyr dependencies
* PhD admin: needs analysis etc.
