(Preparing for) Getting My Hands Dirty
======================================

== Objectives ==

.Carried
* [-] Learn more on reweighted least squares as an example iterative
algorithm
** [X] Read on reweighted least squares
** [ ] Take notes
* [X] Determine if sparklyr mutate occurs locally
* [ ] Retry cluster simulation

.New
* [ ] Determine means of foreach global variable detection
* [X] Determine if futures can be persisted
* [ ] Consider attributes important to large-scale R platforms, e.g. API or
	generic classes; Arbitrary code evaluation; persistence of objects;
	communication between nodes
	** [ ] Make a comparison table
* [ ] More on pbdR, with examples:
	** [ ] Do they offer a specialised API, or generics
	** [ ] What does it take to set up?
	** [ ] Do objects persist at nodes?
	** [ ] Implement reweighted least squares
* [ ] Write on LASSO with reference to the bigmemory implementation
* [ ] Write on other algorithms: ADMM, Random Forest
* [ ] Research possible graph-based algorithms to require node communication

== Discuss ==

* The mechanism of future is very difficult to understand - no documentation
and the code is quite unclear
* Would the promises package be useful to look into? See, for example,
[source, R]
----
promises::then(future::future({
	Sys.sleep(10)
	"Done"
	}))
"Something else"
----
* I should also look at other programming languages that have solved a similar
problem. Through playing with the python server, I came into contact with
python's asynchronous constructs such as `asyncio`. Further searching
revealed interesting asynchronous API's such as Kotlin's coroutines
(concurrent, but not quite parallel), and Julia's `Distributed` library, with
an interesting API derived from MPI, and simplified.
