. Begin sparklyr review
. sparklyr testing
.. Test iteration through `sdf_persist()`
.. Run some tests involving mutate and spark_apply
.. Look in detail at how sparklyr performs mutate functions
.. See if global variables can be attained in mutates with `bquote()`
.. Write on potential and limitations of mutate (with references)
.. Implement Reweighted Least Squares with sparklyr; use pbdR work and Simon's
   hmr version as starting points
.. Compare self-made glm with MLLib glm
.. Reference this within the RWLS document
.. Test sparklyr 1.2 feature; registerDoSpark() with foreach
. Determine possibility and mechanism of recurrance iterators through foreach
  on a cluster, possibly with sparklyr as backend
. Begin prototyping; see ROctopus as relevant experiment
. Remove table notes from link:doc/survey-large-scale-features.tex[Large Scale
  Features document] and add them to their appropriate sections; consider how to
  do this neatly.
