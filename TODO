. Distributed Random Forests
.. List all possible test cases
.. Write tests for all possible cases
.. Download and distribute _flights_ dataset along the cluster
.. reading breiman1993trees to determine how to subset levels (ESL v. unclear)
. Implement the distributed object approach
.. Implement p2p communication (overload `receive`)
.. Implement `align` for dist obj
.. Implement `]` for dist obj
.. Implement `%in%` for dist obj
.. Implement `reader` function for cluster w.r.t. file relative to each node
.. Implement `summary` and its prerequisites with current interface
. Interface: experiment with lazy distributed objects
. Implementation: experiment with metadata being encapsulated in slave processes
. Notes on Hadoop Monitoring links (which port for what, etc.)
.. Create startup script that also starts up web browser with relevant
   monitoring pages
. Remove table notes from link:doc/survey-large-scale-features.tex[Large Scale
  Features document] and add them to their appropriate sections; consider how to
  do this neatly.
. Revisit table with reference to sparklyr-iteration
. Add "degree of control" to the large scale features; capturing how much is
  abstracted vs. still able to be specified by the programmer
