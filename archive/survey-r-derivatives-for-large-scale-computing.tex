\section{ML Services on HDInight}
\label{sec:r-server-hdinsight}

ML Services on HDInsight, also referred to as R Server, is a
distribution of R with particular emphasis on parallel and
capabilities\cite{azure16:_r_server_hdins_r_analy}. Specific parallel
capabilities advertised include multi-threaded mathematics libraries.
R Server for HDInsight was previously named Revolution R, and
developed by Revolution Analytics, before being bought out by
Microsoft, renamed Microsoft R, before acquiring the name R server for
HDInsight, before changing to ML Services.

\section{IBM Big R}
\label{sec:ibm-big-r}

IBM Big R is a library of functions integrating R with the IBM
InfoSphere BigInsights platform\cite{inc.14:_infos_bigin_big_r}. This
is implemented through the introduction of various bigr classes
replicating base R types. These are then run in the background on the
BigInsights platform, which is in turn powered by Apache Hadoop. The
user is therefore able to run MapReduce jobs without having to
explicitly write MapReduce-specific code.

\section{MapR}
\label{sec:mapr}

MapR initially provided R access to Hadoop, being mainly HDFS
access\cite{mapr19:_indus_next_gener_data_platf_ai_analy}. It was then
bought out by HP in May 2019, pivoting to selling an enterprise
database platform and analytics services, running on Hadoop among
other backends. Development has ceased on R access.
