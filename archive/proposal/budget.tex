The development of the project itself, revolving around open-source software, does not come with any budgeting demands.
However, the field of research is rapidly moving, and requires conference attendance and presentations in order to maintain relevance.
This has been budgeted at \$1000.00 per annum, with the funds to be derived from the Postgraduate Research Student Support (PReSS) account, on an as-needed basis.
This is referenced in the Doctoral Provisional Year Review document, and is less than the budget cap of \$1200.00 for the Statistics Department.
