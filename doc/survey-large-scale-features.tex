\maketitle

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

To guide the development of the platform, desirable features are drawn from
existing platforms; inferred as logical extensions; and arrived at through
identification of needs. Some features are mutually exclusive, others are
suggestive of each other, but are worth considering and contrasting their
merits.

\section{Feature List}\label{sec:feature-list}

A list of features and their descriptions follows:

\begin{description}
\item[Distributed Functionality] The ability to spread computation and data
over separate computers
\item[Arbitrary Code Evaluation] The ability to make use of user-specified code
in processing
\item[Arbitrary Iterative Code Evaluation] The ability to process
user-specified code involving iteration over the whole dataset, as opposed to a
simple mapping
\item[Object Persistence at Nodes] The ability to retain objects at their point
of processing
\item[Support for HDFS] Capacity to work with data and computation on the
Hadoop Distributed File System
\item[Ease of Setup] Is setup suitable for a computationally-focussed
statistician, or does it require a system administrator?
\item[Inter-Node Communication] Can any pair of nodes communicate with each
other, or do they only report to a master node? 
\item[Backend Decoupling] The implementation is maintained entirely separately
to the interface
\item[Evaluation of Arbitrary Classes] Any class, including user-defined
classes can be used in evaluation
\item[Direct API] The platform is explicitly programmed against at an interface
\item[Class for Generics] The platform may be set up, then programming makes
use of standard generics that are then utilised
\item[dplyr Compatible] The platform makes use of dplyr as the standard
generics to implicitly program over
\end{description}
