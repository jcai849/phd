\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

To guide the development of the platform, desirable features are drawn from
existing platforms; inferred as logical extensions; and arrived at through
identification of needs. Some features are mutually exclusive, others are
suggestive of each other, but are worth considering and contrasting their
merits.

\section{Feature List}\label{sec:feature-list}

A list of features and their descriptions follows:

\begin{description}
	\item[Distributed Functionality] The ability to spread computation and data
	      over separate computers
		%% cite: importance of concurrancy - mccarthy1983reminiscences
	      %% capacity to handle big data: size & fault-tolerance - ghemawat2003google
	\item[Arbitrary Code Evaluation] The ability to make use of user-specified code
	      in processing
		%% contrast those enabled with those unable to
	\item[Arbitrary Iterative Code Evaluation] The ability to process
	      user-specified code involving iteration over the whole dataset, as opposed to a
	      simple mapping
		%% criticism of mapreduce in zaharia2010spark
	\item[Object Persistence at Nodes] The ability to retain objects at their point
	      of processing
		%% maybe see 1611.09177
	\item[Support for HDFS] Capacity to work with data and computation on the
	      Hadoop Distributed File System
		%% benefits of hdfs - shvachko2010hadoop
	\item[Ease of Setup] Is setup suitable for a computationally-focussed
	      statistician, or does it require a system administrator?
		%% R made for statisticians - rcore2020intro
	      %% lapack setup difficult (example) - quick installation guide (25 pages)
	\item[Inter-Node Communication] Can any pair of nodes communicate with each
	      other, or do they only report to a master node?
		%% benefits shown in MPI - walker1996mpi
	\item[Interactive Usage] The ability to make use of the package in an
	      interactive R session, without mandatory batch execution
		%% Especial notes on debugging
		%% repl importance from mccarthy1978history
	\item[Backend Decoupling] The implementation is maintained entirely separately
	      to the interface
		%% separation of concerns - dijkstra1982role
		%% current performant r systems - eddelbuettel2019parallel
	\item[Evaluation of Arbitrary Classes] Any class, including user-defined
	      classes can be used in evaluation
		%% limitations of just matrices as with pbdR
		%% limitations of just dataframes with anything 'tidy' and spark
		%% value of rich user-defined objects - dahl2004birth 
	\item[Direct API] The platform is explicitly programmed against at an interface
		%% contrast with generics, give examples (foreach)
	\item[Class for Generics] The platform may be set up, then programming makes
	      use of standard generics that are then utilised
	      %% contrast with API, give examples (pbdDMAT, more)
	\item[dplyr Compatible] The platform makes use of dplyr as the standard
	      generics to implicitly program over
	      %% ubiquity of dplyr (try put in something about Rstudio being the 
	      %% Red Hat of R, and dplyr being often redundant to things there 
	      %% before as well as their non-acknowledgement of everything prior 
	      %% (that typically do things better and faster), almost at a level of 
	      %% plaigiarism
