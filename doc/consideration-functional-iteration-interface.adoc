Considerations on a Functional Iterative Interface

Introduction
------------

// Iterative functions
// Why functional?
// Referential transparency
// close mathematical mapping - particularly for statistics
// Contrast with non-functional approaches; object based generators etc.

latexmath:[f^0 = id_x]
latexmath:[f^{n+1} = f \circ f^n]
latexmath:[x_{n+1} = x_n]


A Higher-Order Model for Iterative Functions
--------------------------------------------

// draft interface
[src,R]
------------------
iter(x0, P, xn, ...) 
------------------
Where x0 is the initial object to iterate upon,
P is the predicate upon to stop iteration
xn is the iterative function,
\... is additional arguments
// has this not been done before?? seems too simple

Implementation Details
----------------------

// value of referential transparency allows for backends
Internally, a while loop with predicate `P` runs function `xn` on it's returned
output, starting with `x0`

Optimisations can include substituting the body of the function to avoid
copying variables for the sake of memory.
