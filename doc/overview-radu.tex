\section{Introduction}
% motivation
How does a statistician compose and fit a modelling algorithm for a dataset
consisting of over 165 million flight data?
More generally, how does one perform a statistical analysis over a dataset too
large to fit in computer memory?
There are many solutions to this problem, all involving a variety of tradeoffs.

% solution
What is missing is a platform that is fast and robust, with a focus on a simple
interface for fitting statistical models, and the flexibility for
implementation of arbitrary new models within R.
% demo
\section{State of the Field}
% R packages
% python: dask
\section{System Interface}
% introduction to R; arrays & recycling
% R generic object system S3; function.class as method
% make clear what do.call actually does
\section{System Architecture}
% description of ideal system
% diagram from ...
% explanation of current system (job queues etc.)
\section{Next Steps}
% asynchrony through resolution monitoring
