Iterative Reweighted Least Squares
==================================
:keywords: linear algebra, statistics, iterative

* part of a large family of methods.
* A means of approximation of the beta vector in overdetermined set of equations y=Xb
* solved thorough minimising some function of the error vector e=Xb-y, typically the norm
* Norm can be weighted for emphasis on certain components (equation given p2 (eq. 8))
* sparsity can be increased through greater l_p norms
* iteratively reweighted least squares develops from the inductive equations 16 & 17 p5
