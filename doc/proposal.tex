\section{Background}

\input{doc/proposal/background}

\section{Objectives}

 The objective of this research project is to create a platfom for large-scale
 statistical computing, utilising the versatility and power of R.
 Such a platform will allow statisticians to easily define and run complex
 distributed algorithms from within the R environment, rather than having to
 rely on external tools that never had statistical computation as a goal.
 This platform will be demonstrated through the implementation of iterative
 models in R, and applying these models to real-world tasks on large-scale
 problems.

\section{Scope}
The following tasks will be undertaken as a part of the proposed research:

\begin{itemize}
	\item The creation of a distributed platform in R capable of
		interactively running complex models on large datasets.
	\item The demonstration of such a platform through implementing
		iterative models on larger-than-memory datasets
\end{itemize}

\section{Methodology and Approach}

The principal methodology is to utilise a research software development approach, informed by statistical ends.
This includes experimental research and rapid prototyping, along with open-source practices for public feedback.
Constraints of such an approach include the many software development practices being intended primarily for teams of software developers, which is not the case in this project, as well as the need to engage in marketing in order to have any broad feedback on an open-source project.
An immediate technical challenge that exists is the staggering array of potential technologies that could be used, coupled with the myriad niche demands of end users sitting at varying stages of their respective technologies' hype cycles.
This is typically overcome through experience but failing that, an emphasis on communication and high levels of background research can be used to manage such an uncertainty.
The central use of R also presents it's own challenges, but these are often surmounted through a foreign language interface, such as C.

Further work will continue from the existing prototype, described in section \ref{curr} below.

\section{Current work}\label{curr}

\section{Facilities to be Used}

My own computer, usage of the statistics Ihaka cluster, AWS.
A gpu that can also double for crypto mining??

\section{Budget}

The project, revolving around open-source software, does not come with a demanding budget.
Small expenses are likely, such as AWS time, which will come from existing departmental availability.
Conferences (?)
