\section{Introduction}
A problem exists in the present architecture as described in
\href{experiment-eager-dist-obj-supp.pdf}{Distributed Object supplementary
report}.
At base, the co-ordination between nodes in the cluster requires significant
effort from the master, with little room for additional features, with all
inter-node communication being remote procedure calls only.
This issue compromises nearly every aspect of operations on distributed
objects, particularly in the initial reading in of data, and later data
movement.
The proposed amendments as described in
\href{current-proposed-info-structures.pdf}{Proposed Information Structures}
provide some degree of amelioration, however the root of the issue in requiring
full co-ordinating facilities from the master node is still not solved.

A potential solution exists in the use of message queues.
Message queues are commonly used for inter-process communication, consisting of
queues through which applications may communicate over \cite{curry2004message}.
The use of message queues for communication between nodes will allow for
significantly less knowledge required about other nodes within the system, and
enabling greater independence of action within each node.
Further benefits include allowing for asynchrony in more operations, the
ability to monitor the system externally through watching queues, as well as
the attendant benefits of decentralisation such as potentially greater
resilience and decreased central complexity.

Message queues are well established, seeing use from Operating Systems to Web
Services.
For example, the QNX OS makes heavy use of message queues for its microkernel
architecture \cite{hildebrand1992qnx}.
Tech companies Stack Overflow and flickr also use message queues from redis as
central components of their infrastructure
\cite{nolan2011flickr}\cite{montrose2016stack}.
In this platform, the flexibility of Redis lists and the availability of the
rediscc package suggests the use of Redis in the implementation of message
queues \cite{sanfilippo2009redis}\cite{urbanek2020rediscc}. 
Alternatives include Apache ActiveMQ, Kafka, and Disque, among others
\cite{snyder2011activemq}\cite{garg2013kafka}\cite{sanfilippo2016disque}.

\section{Architecture Concept}
The concept retains the notion of data divided into uniquely identified chunks,
existing on nodes.
The nodes each subscribe to queues dedicated to chunks that they possess,
undertaking action dependent on messages received in their queue.
In this way, nodes function as state machines, reading messages, performing
some operation (or not) depending on the message content, and writing back in
some form.

For example, some node has a chunk \(x\), and receives a message on the \(x\)
queue to add it to another chunk \(y\); if it didn't have the chunk \(y\), it
may post a message on the \(y\) queue, requesting it.
It is likely that the semantics are more general, and the initial message of
operation actually won't specify which chunk to add to \(x\), giving it a more
general request of addition between distributed objects, and the node will have
to determine for itself which chunks to pull to it, if any.

A very simple example is given by listings \ref{src:msg-q-master} and
\ref{src:msg-q-worker}, demonstrating the master and worker node routines
respectively.

\begin{listing}
\inputminted{r}{R/simple-msg-q-master.R}
	\caption{Message queue master node}
	\label{src:msg-q-master}
\end{listing}

\begin{listing}
\inputminted{r}{R/simple-msg-q-worker.R}
	\caption{Message queue worker node}
	\label{src:msg-q-worker}
\end{listing}

The master simply pushes serialised calls to the appropriate queue, and the
worker loops reading messages from it's particular queue(s), unserialising and
evaluating any messages.
The master node and the worker node can be initialised in any order and with
any time difference, demonstrating the asynchrony.
In this particular example, the master puts out a call to add the number 1 to a
predefined chunk named ``chunk'', with the worker executing the call as
expected.
The master doesn't have to have any knowledge about where the chunk exists, and
the worker likewise doesn't necessarily require information on where the
message originated from.

With relation to the queues, the aggregate functionality of nodes in a cluster,
can be considered distinctly to the functionality of a singular node.  
The cluster must have some means of initialising the queues to listen to for
the individual nodes, for the reading in of an external dataset.
The process of operating based on queues is straightforward at the outset, but
requires considerable thought on the representation and existence of objects
other than the referent object of a queue when the queues operations require
those other objects.

The issue of data movement also requires consideration; while this is largely
an implementation-specific issue, it has a strong bearing on conceptual
architecture.
These three considerations mirror the state machine concept at an aggregate
level, with resultant decisions affecting the architecture at large.

\section{Plausible Extensions}

While the use of message queues looks to ease many significant issues, there
are additional problems that it require addressing, primarily resulting from
the asynchrony and decentralisation.

Most pressingly, the issue of deadlock, in the context of data movement; in the
process of nodes requesting and transferring data, a deadlock is almost certain
to occur if not dealt with.
This specific instance may be helped through careful implementation and more
processing on the initiator node (bringing it closer to a master node), but a
possibly superior extension is to have queue-adjacent servers on each node that
are able to operate concurrently with the main R session that has as it's sole
purpose the transfer of chunks, leaving everything else to the main R session.
These servers would also be ideal vertices at which to implement
data-duplication as a feature enabling redundancy in the system

In a similar vein, failure detection can be implemented through a concurrent
``heartbeat'' server, in the same manner as Hadoop \cite{white2012hadoop}.

These extensions are worth bearing in mind for now, however the considerations
brought up in the prior section need to be answered first.
