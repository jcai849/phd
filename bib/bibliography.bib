@BOOK{HastieTrevor2001Teos,
  ABSTRACT  = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

  ABSTRACT  = {Publisher Summary Distributed computing is an activity that is performed on a spatially distributed system. An important problem in distributed computing is to provide a user with a non-distributed view of a distributed system to implement a distributed file system that allows the client programmer to ignore the physical location of his data. The models of computation generally considered to be distributed are process models in which the computational activity is represented as the concurrent execution of sequential processes. Different process models are distinguished by the mechanism employed for inter-process communication. The process models that are most distributed are the ones in which processes communicate by message passing. A process sends a message by adding it to a message queue and another process receives the message by removing it from the queue. There are two basic complexity measures for distributed algorithms: time and message complexity. The time complexity of an algorithm measures the time needed both for message transmission and for computation within the processes. The most common measure of message complexity is the total number of messages transmitted. If messages contain on the order of a few hundred bits or more, then the total number of bits sent might be a better measure of the cost than the number of messages.},

  ABSTRACT     = {The term \textquotedblleft{}{}referential transparency\textquotedblright{}{} is frequently used to indicate that a programming language has certain useful substitution properties. We observe, however, that the formal and informal definitions given in the literature are not equivalent and we investigate their relationships. To this end, we study the definitions in the context of a simple expression language and show that in the presence of non-determinism, the differences between the definitions are manifest. We propose a definition of \textquotedblleft{}{}referential transparency\textquotedblright{}{}, based on Quine's, as well as of the related notions: definiteness and unfoldability. We demonstrate that these notions are useful to characterize programming languages.},
